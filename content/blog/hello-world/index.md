This is my first post on my new blog! How exciting!

I'm sure I'll write a lot more interesting things in the future.

Oh, and here's a great quote from this Wikipedia on
[security hacker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_hacker).

> Are hackers a threat? The degree of threat presented by any
> conduct, whether legal or illegal, depends on the actions and
