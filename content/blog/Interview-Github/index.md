### Security Telemetry 

I applied to github for the application security engineer on their carrers website.
I had lost hope. I never thought I would even pass the ats(application tracking system).
But at 4th feb midnight I recieved and I was estatic. On the 10th feb I had a coverstation about my pervious internship experiences and my projects with the Senior Talent Partner

### What The Interview Process looks like? 
- Coverstation with the highring manager 
- Technical Coding Exercise
- Inteview with the Tech team based on the coding exercise
- Interview about the leadership roles
- Interview about Diversity and able to work with people from different cultures
